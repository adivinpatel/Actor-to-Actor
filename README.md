1. This is an actor to actor comparison that allows for 2 input actors and checks to see if they have been related to each other through Hindi movies between 2010 and 2023
2. There are 2 relations it tests: Direct realtion and relation via one middle actor (an actor both actors have worked with)
3. You can test the code through the following examples:

Direct Actor to Actor: Salman Khan to Disha Patani
Actor to Actor with Mutual Actor: Salman Khan to Varun Dhawan

4. The code does print every movie the actors have worked together in for mutual actors
5. The code prints out the actor name and movie for a middle actor if the actors have not worked together directly

6. If the actors have no middle actor or no direct relation, the code will return that they have no link
